# Date-Library
A C++ Library
This library tries to add support for Date data type in C++ to deal with calendar dates ranging between 01/Jan/1950
and 31/Dec/2049. The dates support the basic operations for a Date type as defined in the class
definition (in Date.h). Further dates are formatted for i/o using the DateFormat class.
